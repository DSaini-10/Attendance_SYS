# Attendance_SYS
An ML based project to automate the boring and time consuming process of manual attendance checking using the face_recognition model using HOGs (Histogram of oriented gradients) of student images.


# How to Use this Project

1. Clone this repository in your system.
2. Install Python's Image, face_recognition,numpy, firebase_admin libraries ,cv2 (if not installed previously).
3. Add the pictures of students in the Images folder which is although connected to the firebase storage container but it can be bypassed for ease of testing.
4. Run the Encode_gen.py file to generate the encodings.

Congratulations! You can now run the main code file and mark some attendees!
